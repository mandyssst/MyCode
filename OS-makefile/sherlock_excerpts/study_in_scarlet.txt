 "I have no objection," Lestrade answered, seating himself. "I freely confess that I was of the opinion that Stangerson was concerned in the death of
 Drebber. This fresh development has shown me that I was completely mistaken. Full of the one idea, I set myself to find out what had become of the
 Secretary. They had been seen together at Euston Station about half-past eight on the evening of the third. At two in the morning Drebber had been
 found in the Brixton Road. The question which confronted me was to find out how Stangerson had been employed between 8.30 and the time of the crime,
 and what had become of him afterwards. I telegraphed to Liverpool, giving a description of the man, and warning them to keep a watch upon the
 American boats. I then set to work calling upon all the hotels and lodging-houses in the vicinity of Euston. You see, I argued that if Drebber and
 his companion had become separated, the natural course for the latter would be to put up somewhere in the vicinity for the night, and then to hang
 about the station again next morning."

"They would be likely to agree on some meeting-place beforehand," remarked Holmes.

"So it proved. I spent the whole of yesterday evening in making enquiries entirely without avail. This morning I began very early, and at eight
o'clock I reached Halliday's Private Hotel, in Little George Street. On my enquiry as to whether a Mr. Stangerson was living there, they at once
answered me in the affirmative.

"'No doubt you are the gentleman whom he was expecting,' they said. 'He has been waiting for a gentleman for two days.'

"'Where is he now?' I asked.

"'He is upstairs in bed. He wished to be called at nine.'

"'I will go up and see him at once,' I said.
